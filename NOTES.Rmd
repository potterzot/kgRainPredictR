* Radar measure is related to distance, since the angle changes the farther you are. See e.g. [this image](http://jcsites.juniata.edu/faculty/johnson/projects/hydromet_module/content/topic2_evaluating/images/MULTI.PNG)
* Ref is not "Radar Reflectivity in km", the units are [dBZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBZ_(meteorology).
* Expected is the expected amount of rain recorded by the gauge in the last hour in mm. There are a significant number of records that are out of bounds (>69mm)
* test records without a `Ref` measure are no longer counted toward score, but must still be predicted.
